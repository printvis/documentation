# PrintVis Onboarding – Time Registration

This documentation is a supporting manual on how to use the PrintVis
Onboarding Setup. It describes the required setup steps for this module.

# PrintVis Time Registration

This setup allows your employees to document their time consumed per
order. Registered time is posted against PrintVis orders. However, it
does not itself generate any costs. At the stage of PrintVis Job Costing
setup, it will be possible to set up your Cost Centers and their
associated hourly rates for full shop floor data collection and job
costing.

This portion of your time registration setup has been made simple and
easy to use.

Please click on the Role Center Tile “Ready for setup.” If the PrintVis
Case Management Module has been completed, the Time Registration setup
is available.
