# PrintVis Onboarding – Case Management – Departments

This documentation is a supporting manual, how to use the PrintVis
Onboarding Setup. It describes the required setup steps for this module.

# PrintVis Departments Setup

Departments are used to define where Cost Centers (employees and
machinery) belong. Departments are used throughout the system for
statistical purposes and constitute the primary grouping of the
presentation on the different screens such as the calculation windows,
shop floor, etc. and in certain reports such as the job ticket.

Departments are used to group production or customer information that
can be entered by the user. Make sure also to set up administrative and
shipping departments for service information.

Please click on “Departments” to get started.

Please note:  
Plan enough time to be able to finish a full step for each setup. This
may require 15 minutes or more.

## Building a Set of Suggested PrintVis Departments

After clicking on “Departments” the message below is displayed while
data is imported.

After the import is complete, the list below is displayed.

You can just overwrite the list with your departments. The Code can be
letters, numbers, or both. However, the number allows easy sorting and
aids with cost centers that will be set up later.
