# PrintVis Onboarding – Case Management – Order Types

This documentation is a supporting manual on how to use the PrintVis
Onboarding Setup. It describes the required setup steps for this module.

# PrintVis Order Types Setup

Order Types are used in the system to group job types together for
production statistics. Typically, the Order Type is combined with a
Product Group. Order Types are attached directly to a Case.

Please click on “Order Types” to get started.

<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Field</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Select</th>
<td><p>The selected line is indicated with a check box. You can disable
the line individually if you do not want to create it in the setup.</p>
<p>Above the list of Order Types, you will find the actions 'Deselect
All' and 'Select All.'</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>

to something that fits with your company.</td>
