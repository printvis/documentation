# EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) 

The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) (Regulation (EU) 2023/1115)
requires companies that place, make available, or export certain
commodities and products within the European Union to demonstrate that
these goods are deforestation-free, legally produced, and traceable to
their origin.

To comply with these requirements, operators and traders must prepare
and submit a Due Diligence Statement (DDS) through the EU’s official
TRACES information system. The DDS may also be provided by a vendor if
the products already include a verified Due Diligence Statement.

Each DDS confirms that the company has completed the necessary due
diligence to verify compliance with the EUDR. For traceability
documentation, the DDS must be tracked in the system for products or
items that are stocked (raw materials and finished goods) or consumed in
production.

This software module supports users in tracking all DDS numbers for
consumables and other regulated materials.
