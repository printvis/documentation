# PrintVis Rejection Codes Setup

The Rejection Code is used to indicate the reason a quote was rejected.

This information can be collected for statistical analysis to summarize
the different reasons for rejecting a quote, e.g., price, date or lack
of materials. Rejection Codes are also used for relationship management
to keep track of lost opportunities. The Status Code “REJECTED”,
suggested in the standard Status Code setup, includes a setting making
it impossible to cancel a case without selecting a Rejection Code.

Please click on “Rejection Codes” to get started.
