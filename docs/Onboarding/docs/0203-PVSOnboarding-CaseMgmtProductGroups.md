After the import is completed, the list below is displayed.

This is a list of common Product Groups. You can deselect any that are
not required. In the next step you can create additional Product Groups
that are missing.

You can also overwrite the list with your daily Product Groups. The Code
can be letters or numbers - or a combination of both. The code is simply
for quick reference when building a job.
