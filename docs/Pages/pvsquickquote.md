# Quick Quote
The Quick Quote is designed for a user such as a CSR or an account manager with less experience in understanding calculations. The user can easily handle simple orders like business cards, posters, magazines and large format products that are standardized without involving an estimator. It serves as an easy entry point while talking to a customer. By entering standardized data or using a questionnaire, when the user clicks the calculate menu action the quick quote populates the case in the background. From here, a quote can be directly made, or an experienced estimator can take over to finish the estimate for a quote.

Quick Quote is used for quick estimation of standard products, but it is possible in the setup to enable the user to add extra services, DTP, Varnish on Cover, Table Work etc.

From the Quick Quote Page, it is possible to access the **Case** card if you want to check the calculation or change status to an Order.

The PrintVis Quick Quote is an interface layer on top of the PrintVis Calculation, providing limited and standardized options for the user. Therefore, before setting up the quick quote, a final setup with all calculation units is necessary. The quick quote works based on the calculation unit setup and templates. In case any changes are made to the related calculation units, the templates must be updated accordingly!
