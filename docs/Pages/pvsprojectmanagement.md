# Project Management
PrintVis gives you Project Management - a simple and powerful way to oversee every facet of elaborate projects that may include extended consultancy hours, recurring design work, multiple production runs and shipments – all the underlying elements of a large campaign which needs to be properly managed for a successful business.  Users just mark a **Case** as Main Project or assign cases to a Project.

## Use of Project Management
Field and buttons for Project Management are on the **Case Card**.  All Cases no matter the type (Request, Quote, Order) can be added to a Project.  There is no setup needed to begin using Project Management.
- First you need to mark a **Case**, as **Main Project**, which is done from the menu called **WorkFlow**
- Then, that case is the **Main Project** case and other cases can be linked to it, which is done from the field **Belongs to Project** field in the General section of the Case Card 
- A **Project Manager** can be designated in the field Project Manager (the user must be marked as a Coordinator in the **PrintVis User** setup)
- Project Name will be taken from **Job Name** from the Case marked as **Main Project**
On The **PrintVis Coordinator** role center, there is a tile for Project Cases.  In Case Management, you can set a filter for these using **Belongs to Project ID <> ‘’**.
From the PrintVis Case List, it is possible to view project statistics by going to Related => Order => Project Statistics.  It is also possible to access the project statistics page from the case card, by going to Related => Project Statistics.

The project statistics page shows all the cases connected to the project with information such as invoiced amount, remaining amount, estimated hours, posted hours, etc.

## Invoicing Project Cases
There are several options to consider when invoicing project cases.  It can be decided on a project-by-project basis to invoice in these specific ways:
- Invoice each case under the project individually
- Build invoices (drafts) for each case under the project (or have PrintVis auto-build these drafts when the case is fully shipped), but then use the **Combine Invoice** feature to combine the drafts into a single invoice to send to the customer
- Custom build a special function for a **PrintVis Invoice Template** to invoice cases/projects in a very specific way
