# PrintVis Industry Captions

PrintVis Industry Captions allow a company to set the field captions in areas of PrintVis based on the industry of the company, order type, or product group. This allows the flexibility to configure the system to match company terminology and industry standards. If no industry captions are set up, the system uses the default PrintVis captions.

**Setup**

Caption sets are configured separately in each company. Multiple caption sets can be used in a single company. The Industry Captions page is where you set up each caption set for the different types of captions needed.

Highlighting a caption set and clicking edit will allow the user to edit the captions for each individual field.

For each field, language translations can be used by clicking on the number in the Translations column. The appropriate caption for the language can be entered for each language code.

The Generate Industry Lines action allows for the quick creation of industry captions based on defaults weâ€™ve experienced for different industries. The default options currently available include Commercial Printing (our default captions), Label, Packaging, and Apparel.

The usage page is how the caption sets are assigned to the different order types or product groups. When setting up caption set usage, a blank line is always needed to assign the standard caption set to be used when order type and product group are not available. There are field captions from fields like "Paper" (Item Type), Tools/Dies, etc. These captions will always be taken from the default caption set.

Once a default caption set is set on the blank line, each line after can have an order type or product group selected with the appropriate caption set to be used when that order type or product group are selected on a case.

**Use**

Once caption sets are set up in the system, it will display the appropriate captions based on the blank, order type, or product group caption usage. There are some fields, such as on the tool, that are not job related. These fields will always use the blank, default caption set.
