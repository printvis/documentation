# Industry Captions
The PrintVis Industry Captions allow a company to set the field captions in areas of PrintVis based on the industry of the company, order type, or product group.  This allows the flexibility to configure the system to match company terminology and industry standards.  If no industry captions are set up, the system uses the default PrintVis captions.

Caption sets are configured separately in each company.  Multiple caption sets can be used in a single company.  The Industry Captions page is where you set up each caption set for the different types of captions needed.

Default captions are for Commercial Printing.

We have standard industry captions for following segments:
- Commercial Printing (Default)
- Label
- Packaging
- Apparel (when apparel add-on is installed)
