# PrintVis Item Type Code Filter

Item Type Code Filters can be used to set up which Item Type Codes are available based on the current PrintVis Order Type, Product Group, or Cost Center. Cost Center in this context is the selected press/machine on the PrintVis Job Item.

## How it works

The Item Type Code Filter setup is available on the setup page for order types, product groups, cost centers, or can be called directly.

With this setup, it is possible to limit available materials (mostly paper/print substrates) for ease of use based on the current order type/product group/cost center. The user must choose only from the list of relevant items for the current estimate.

A format code filter is available if only specific sizes should be available for cost centers/presses. The Format Code filter references the format code from the item card.

It is possible to set up filters on Item Type Code for:

- Order Types
- Product Groups
- Cost Centers
