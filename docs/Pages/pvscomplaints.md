# Complaints
The Complaint functionality is used for structured registration of the complaints received by the company. It will help you form an overview of the complaints received in the long term and then you may group the complaints according to your own complaint codes.

It is also possible to create a credit memo from the complaint which will also be attached directly to the **Case** and if necessary to make out an invoice to a vendor based on an already made out credit memo

The Complaints functionality is intended to handle any complaints or reactions from customers, for example, resulting in credits or rework of a job.
