# Cost Center
A Cost Center is characterized as a machine, function, workplace, or person. Here you enter all known and fixed properties of the specific Cost Center. These are: resources, speeds, material consumption, slack, prices, variable profit, operations, shop floor, work codes etc. This secures the Cost Center as a uniform basis for administrative procedures, whereas variables must be entered in the operations-only, such as number, size, job, etc.

The Cost Center is a central part of PrintVis and is very important for the use of the following functions: calculation, **Scheduling** (indirectly via Capacity Units), shop floor, **Job Costing**, and statistics.

In order for these five functions to work correctly, all Cost Centers are attached to one **department**.

There are four principal elements which constitute a Cost Center. Before you are able to use a Cost Center in the system you must be aware of the setup and configuration of the individual elements.

In **PrintVis Assisted Setup** we have a list of many of the machines in the graphic industry. When you create a new Cost Center from Assisted Setup, our default setup is selected, however, you have the option before final creation to adapt Scrap, Speed, Operation so that they fit your specific environment.

It is also from the Cost Center that you check what the individual operator can see in the Shop Floor, this allows for a unique setup that suits the selected machine, for example, it may be that you only use Quality Assurance on printing machines and not finishing or different Unit of Measures.
