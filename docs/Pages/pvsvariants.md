# Using Product Variants

After creating product versions on the PrintVis job and creating the sheets and job items that are required for your product (see also <a href="../pvsversionparts/" target="_self">Job Version / Product Parts</a>), you can now create the desired variants.

On this variant page, you can see a line for each product version and a column for each sheet that was created.

If all product versions contain the same variants, you can just hit the **Create Variants** action. This will add a code from the text into each variant column. If a specific variant is not part of all versions, you can just remove it again.

It is also possible to enter codes manually if you want to give them a specific code for better identification when combining sheets.

For the example that is mentioned on the product versions page (see also <a href="../pvsversionparts/" target="_self">Job Version / Product Parts</a>), you have three different versions: the **English**, the **Italian**, and the **German Edition**. You have 4 columns:

1. **The cover**
2. **The 16 pages text**
3. **The 8 pages text**
4. **The advertisement for the English and German version only**

You can just write **ENG-ADVERT** and **GER-ADVERT** into the variants for the **English** and **German Edition**, and you can leave the **Italian Edition** blank because this one does not contain this advertisement variant. PrintVis automatically calculates the job item quantity for this insert for the advertisements.

## Next Step

After the variants are created, you can go ahead and combine sheets and/or plate changes. See also <a href="../pvscombinedsheets/" target="_self">Combined Sheets</a>).
