# Product Groups
Product Groups are used to control a large part of basic information on a **Case**, and also to categorize the company's different products for statistical information - for example on production and sales.

A Product Group is attached directly to a Case. The case is then, statistically speaking, included in the selected Product Group, but may also be used on specific job lines for the case - typically to control imposition information and perhaps basic templates.

It is possible to assign Product Groups to Order Types. If the **Order Type** is set up to filter Product Groups, the user will only be presented with the product groups belonging to the selected Order Type when cases are created. 

You may attach a basic template per Product Group, so that only the selection of the Product Group decides that the **Calculation Units** of the basic template are included in the job.

Typically, a basic **Template** is used to secure that at least the Calculation Units, always included in production, are selected by default - this saves the user more selections.

PrintVis offers the possibility to add up to 10 KPI's to be automatically calculated for each Job. KPI's are to be linked to Product groups - and the requested Headings/Captions per KPI must be set on the Product Group Setup individually.

**Milestones** are used to add non-production tasks or requirements that must be completed for a job. On a Product Group you can select the list of milestones required for that product. 

Product Groups may also be included as a parameter in e.g. the Scrap and Speed calculations.

Generally, from a Product Group you can control information on:
- Statistical grouping
- Standard Description
- Eco-label
- Basic templates
- Imposition information
- Tools
- Invoice building
- Key figures via the company's Product Groups
- Milestones
