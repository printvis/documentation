# Responsibility Areas
Responsibility Areas are how you set up and maintain the company case flow.  Generally, this function is used for designating who or what group becomes responsible for a case when it reaches a given **Status Code**, and for defining what status is used when **Change Status** is selected on the case. 

The setup of Responsibility Areas is a very general option in relation to controlling the case sequence and distributing the responsibility for the case per Status Code.

## Use of Responsibility Areas
In addition to the standard assignment of **Change Status**, you can set up individual users or user groups (Teams) to be responsible for cases in a Status Code.  For example, a group of planners can become responsible for all cases in the status code "PLAN - Ready for Schedule".

In addition to a normal workflow, it is possible to set up special workflows based on Order types, Customer groups, or Sell-To customers.

Regardless of the setup of Responsibility Areas, the individual case will always retain the Coordinator, Salesperson, Estimator, and Project Manager throughout the entire lifecycle of PrintVis.
