# Opportunities/CRM

Business Central relationship management tools are often sufficient for printing companies, and PrintVis integrates with these features to make it easier for sales and marketing teams to build segments, track opportunities, and apply discount codes to PrintVis cases based on selected campaigns.

**Segments**

Segments allow a company to focus their interactions according to specific criteria. PrintVis has extended this functionality to allow for the selection of PrintVis case specific criteria, such as **Order Type, Product Group**, and sales amounts. Once you create a new segment, there is a button in the top menu called “PrintVis Add Contacts.” All additional functionality is standard Business Central.

**Opportunities**

Opportunities are another standard Business Central feature that allows salespeople and managers to track sales cycles and interactions for opportunities with a customer. PrintVis has added some functionality to opportunities to allow a salesperson to remain in the opportunity but also interact with PrintVis cases.

A **PrintVis case** can be created from the opportunity and a link is established between the opportunity and the PrintVis case. Once the **case** is created, the salesperson can monitor the progress of the sales cycle and mark the opportunity won or lost through the opportunity.

When the opportunity is updated, the estimated sales value is pulled directly from the PrintVis active quote line.

**Campaigns**

Business Central campaigns are used to create activities or tasks. Campaigns can be attached to opportunities which is how PrintVis will interact with campaigns. PrintVis has added our **discount group** field to the campaign setup page.
