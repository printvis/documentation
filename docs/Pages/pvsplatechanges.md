# Using Plate Changes

The PrintVis plate changes are useful if a product has, for example, different language versions that can be managed by plate changes for the same sheet. For each plate change, the quantity, description, and the plates and colors to change can be entered. With this information, PrintVis is calculating the correct setup/production time, scrap, and plate consumption based on the number of required stops and additional required plates.

Plate changes could be already/also created using the PrintVis Versioning functionality. See also: <a href="../pvsversionparts/" target="_self">Job Version / Product Parts</a> and <a href="../pvscombinedsheets/" target="_self">Combined Sheets</a>, which require more input but can be used if different variants should be combined on the same sheet.

## The First Line as Initial Run

After entering the number of plate changes on the job item, this page displays one line for each plate change and the first line for the initial run of the current sheet. In the first line, it is only possible to enter the Quantity and the Description that reflect the first version which is using the Colors front/back information from the Job Item.

## Details on Plate Change Lines

For the following plate changes, Change 1, Change 2, etc., please enter the number of plates to be changed into the fields Plate-/Color change Front and Plate-/Color change Back. In those fields, a dialog opens when hitting the “Three Dots button”. The page shows the available inks chosen for the sheet. Please select the inks that require a plate change as additional information and close the dialog by clicking OK. Finalize each line by entering the Quantity and the Description.

In the bottom of the page, the fields Quantity Changes and Quantity Total are displayed. The Quantity Total is the quantity from the job item and the Quantity Changes is the total quantity of all lines on this page. After plate changes are completed, the values in the field Quantity Changes and Quantity Total must be the same.

After all information is entered correctly, close the page by hitting Close.

This process is available for each sheet.
