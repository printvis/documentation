# Shop Floor - Barcode Input (Scan Lot No.)

## Summary

In the \*\*Shop Floor - Consume Lot\*\* page, there is a field called \*\*"Barcode"\*\*.  

The \*\*Consume Materials\*\* window is designed for use with a \*\*barcode scanner\*\*, as lot numbers are typically impractical for manual user entry.

> This functionality is \*\*intended only for consumption of Lot Number controlled materials\*\* – so usually not applicable to standard sheet or web printer companies.

### Setup

From \*\*PrintVis Shop Floor Setup\*\*, you can specify which page to use for \*\*“Shop Floor Consume Materials”\*\*.  

Update the settings accordingly:

- \*\*PrintVis Shop Floor Setup\*\*

This can also be configured \*\*per user\*\* in the \*\*PrintVis User List Setup\*\*:

- \*\*PrintVis User Setup\*\*

In a company using both \*\*Lot\*\* and \*\*non-Lot\*\* raw materials:

- Users will consume \*\*Lot materials\*\* through page \*\*6010785\*\*.

- \*\*Non-Lot materials\*\* are consumed through page \*\*6010787\*\*, which allows:

- Manual entry of raw materials by item number

- Automatic population of raw materials planned for the job
