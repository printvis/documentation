### Job Costing

The first tab provides a total overview of the orders:

Quote Estimation - The Quote Estimation shows the calculation of the active quote made to the customer, that is on the basis of the preconditions which are known at this time. An active quote is the active quote job line in Graphic case card.

Order Estimation - The Order Estimation shows the calculation of the items which the customer has actually ordered. The standard calculation shows the sum of the calculations in the active job lines of the Order type - these may be found on Graphic Case Card.

Actual Job Costing - The Actual Job Costing shows the sum of registered hours, materials and direct purchases. The job costing entries show the sum of postings on the order with all the jobs of the order.

Farthest to the right, the Normal Calculation and the Actual Job Costing are compared - both amounts and percentages.
