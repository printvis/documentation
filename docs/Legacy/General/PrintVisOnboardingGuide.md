# PrintVis Onboarding Guide

## Introduction

PrintVis Onboarding is designed to help users get started with the software, understand its features and functionalities, and become proficient in using it. While this is not our first attempt to facilitate a do-it-yourself experience with the system, Microsoft is improving their own onboarding experience for Business Central, and we are doing the same for PrintVis.

With just a few simple steps, prospects can easily embark on a trial period, allowing them to explore the capabilities of the system in a hands-on manner. Our aim is to make the initial setup and exploration process as smooth and straightforward as possible.

Please find some screenshots for the setup guides below. The guide itself includes all the information for users to follow and complete the setup steps.

## Onboarding Role Center

- **Automatic Role Assignment:** The Role Center will be set for new cloud users automatically.
- **Manual Role Selection:** It is possible to choose the "PrintVis Onboarding" role manually.

## User Screen

### Entry-Level Modules

Entry-level modules include:

- Basic Setup
- Case Management
- Folder Management
- User Fields
- Time Registration

More modules will follow soon.

### Setup Screens

Examples for the setup screens will be provided to guide users through the process.

## System Integration

The idea is to think of PrintVis as a complete system built of interconnected modules. Some of these modules rely on information from others and must be set up according to their dependencies. More advanced modules may require help from an experienced PrintVis Implementation Partner.

By following the step-by-step instructions, new users can gradually adopt PrintVis and apply it to their existing operations. This incremental approach allows for a controlled and manageable deployment, minimizing disruptions to day-to-day activities.

## Status Updates

After each module is set up, its status is displayed as "Ready."

## Conclusion

The goal is to enable prospects to effortlessly start their journey with the trial, followed by a structured onboarding process that allows them to gradually go live and unlock the full potential of PrintVis and Business Central. We hope our onboarding process will significantly enhance the user experience and contribute to the successful adoption and utilization of PrintVis.
