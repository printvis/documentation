# Item Qualities - PV Assisted Setup


## Introduction

PrintVis Qualities are used as settings on Items within PrintVis. Each item must have a quality assigned to it. Without an assigned quality, certain options in calculations or other features may be unavailable. Qualities affect various aspects, including:

- Showing an Item in the Material Transfer list
- Displaying an Item in the PrintVis Purchase Guide
- Defining the PrintVis Cost price (for calculation)
- Serving as a speed-impacting parameter in Speed Tables
- And more

PrintVis Qualities are a sub-type of Item Type. On the Item card, only those Qualities assigned to the selected Item Type will be available.
