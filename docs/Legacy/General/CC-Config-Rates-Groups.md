# Cost Center Setup / Configuration / Rates / Groups

## Summary
A Cost Center is characterized as a machine, function, workplace, or person with a fixed-hour rate. Here, once and for all, you must enter all known and fixed values which are weighed in relation to the properties of the specific Cost Center. These are: resources, speeds, material consumption, slack, prices, variable profit, operations, etc. This secures the Cost Center as a uniform basis for administrative procedures, whereas variables must be entered in the operations-only, such as number, size, job, etc.

The Cost Center is a central part of PrintVis and is very important to the use of the following functions:

- Calculation
- Planning (indirectly via Capacity Units)
- Job Costing
- Statistics

In order for these four functions to work correctly, all Cost Centers are attached to one department and one capacity unit.

There are four principal elements which constitute a Cost Center. Before you are able to use a Cost Center in the system you must be aware of the setup and configuration of the individual elements.

### Create a Cost Center

#### Create a Cost Center from Reference Company (PrintVis Assisted Setup)

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 2.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 2.jpg)

There are two options to import data from a reference environment:

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 3.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 3.jpg)

1. **Add Cost Center**
    - Reads the cost center data for one configuration (you can pick what you need) and creates Calculation Units on the fly 1:1 for each configuration.
    - This is the default option when importing from the PrintVis machine database as part of the PrintVis Assisted Setup.

2. **Add Cost Center and All Configurations**
    - Imports all Cost Center Configurations from a cost center with all existing Calculation Units.
    - Codes and descriptions for all entries are updated accordingly, making it possible to import a cost center more than once (duplicate it).
    - If codes/descriptions become too long, they will be truncated automatically.
    - This option is especially useful for customers maintaining their machinery in a "master" environment.
    - The web service must point to the "master" environment.


The system uses the reference company from the PrintVis General Setup:

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 4.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 4.jpg)

If the web service is pointing to a cloud environment as a reference environment, it is required to use OAuth2 authentication. 


This section in the PrintVis General Setup must be used to configure authentication.

#### Copy Cost Center
Action on Cost Center list and Cost Center Card.

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 6.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 6.jpg)

- Enter a new **CODE**, a new **Name**, and a new **List of Unit Names**, then select which configurations to copy.

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 7.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 7.jpg)

- Choose what should be kept or copied.

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 8.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 8.jpg)


- **Price Lists, Scrap Tables, Speed Tables, Planning Unit, and Capacity Unit** can be either:
  - 'Copy existing' - The system copies information from the original Cost Center and assigns a new Unit Code.
  - 'Re-use existing' - Uses already existing data in the new Cost Center.

---

#### Export/Import Cost Center
Actions on the Cost Center list.

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 9.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 9.jpg)

##### Export Cost Center
- The `Export Cost Center` action creates an XML `.txt` file.
- During export, a couple of dialogs appear:
  1. The system asks for the standard unit used within the Cost Center.

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 10.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 10.jpg)

  2. It asks whether rates should be exported or not.

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 11.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 11.jpg)

- Once the user confirms, the `.txt` file is downloaded to the user's PC.

##### Import Cost Center
- The `Import Cost Center` action asks for the XML `.txt` file to be uploaded.

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 12.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 12.jpg)

- A dialog appears displaying information about the Cost Center to be imported, requiring user input:

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 13.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 13.jpg)

  1. Enter the **Department** the Cost Center should be associated with.
  2. The system lists missing item numbers in the Cost Center setup.
     - The user can either remove the missing item numbers or keep them.
  3. A dialog appears allowing the user to change the operation text being imported.

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 14.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 14.jpg)

Once confirmed, the system imports the full setup of the Cost Center, including connected **Calculation Units** and **Capacity Units**.



### Cost Center Card Page

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 15.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 15.jpg)

The Cost Center card is where you store the basic information for each Cost Center, Machine, Workplace, or "dummy" that might be needed for a costing structure. Linked to the Cost Center are subsequent configurations, operations, hourly rates, etc.

The Cost Center card contains 4 major sections:

- **General**
- **Shop Floor**
- **Manufacturing Integration/CIM**
- **Factbox**

## Configuration

Via the Configuration card, calculation master data attached to a Cost Center is created and maintained. In the configuration, you define operations and their calculation methods, attachment to a Scrap table, machine configurations, system formulas, operations, hourly rates, etc.

Every Cost Center contains at least one configuration, which, as the default setting, is the basic configuration of the Cost Center. Most Cost Centers only contain this one configuration, but there are other cases where it is necessary to create more configurations for a Cost Center. Mainly, if you want to be able to choose both a Basic configuration and one or more additional configurations.

Additional configurations are typically used for a rotary printing machine where you may attach a cutting unit, or a stitching machine where addressing may be chosen as an additional configuration.

You may also want to be able to choose between different basic configurations. This is typically if you have a 4-5 color printing machine but want to make "political" calculations on 1 and 2 colored prints. This means the machine must calculate with other hourly rates, rather than by 4-5 colored prints.

### General

The **General** tab is used to set up the configuration's basic parameters. In this section, you can select the machine, finishing types, and more. This is especially important when the Cost Center's "Machine Type" field is set to **Mixed Configuration**.

### Operations

The table in the **Operations** FastTab must contain all operations for the selected configuration. An operation is characterized by the fact that the calculated time often forms the basis for pricing the operation.

However, in some cases, you may choose to attach a **price list** to an operation and perform **Cost** and/or **Sales** price calculations based on the criteria established in the price list.

 Example Setup:

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 27.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 27.jpg)

  - **Standard**: Printed sheet is split horizontally.
  - **Vertical**: Items placed in vertical divisions.
  - **Successively**: Especially for label printing, prints more variants in the same process.                                           |
| **Runs per Sheet/Web**          | Calculates the number of necessary runs in a printing process based on the machine's color capacity.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Max. format exceeded**         | Defines the machine's response if a sheet is larger than the printing machine's capacity:  
  - **Blank**: No reaction, suggests sheet division.
  - **Warning**: Gives a warning, splits the sheet.
  - **Stop**: Gives a warning, and does not allow insertion.                                                                              |
| **Trimming the sheet/web**      | Choose the principle for cutting paper if it is too large for the machine:  
  - **Equal split**: Splits the sheet down the middle.
  - **Cut to maxformat**: Cuts to the machine's max format.
  - **Use the whole sheet/web**: Optimizes the entire inventory sheet.                                                                          |
| **Cutting distance**            | Enter (in centimeters) the cutting distance between items on the sheet.                                                                                                                                                                      |

|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Operations per length**       | Enter the operation per length. (Length = 1 meter, Operation = one pass â€” this means one action forth and back).                                                                                                                             |


### Planning
This tab only has one field where, by a look-up in the field, you select which Capacity Unit you want to use in connection with production planning. You may select a different Capacity Unit from the one selected on the Cost Center.

### Calculation
Via this tab, enter the formula which is to form the basis of the total calculation next to each of the available functions.

As a default, PrintVis contains built-in calculation rules for the functions displayed and thus also calculation formulas, which are able to calculate the ordinary matters in connection with printing and finishing machines. You should only replace the system formulas with user-defined formulas or other system formulas, if you want to change these calculation rules.

If you need to enter or change a formula, we recommend checking the setup for an equal type of machine.

If, for example, you want a specific calculation of Quantity per stroke for a stitching machine or a book alley, you may enter a specific formula in this field.

If you have changed the formula selection on this tab, you will go through the selection with troubleshooting in the setup if the machine does not calculate as you expected.

Apart from the fixed calculations in the processes which are shown on this tab, three open formula fields are shown where you may enter formulas which may calculate simultaneously with this process. These formulas may be combined with the other formulas which are inserted in the calculation, and which refer to the result in the process. This could be byproducts of the printing process.

### JDF
Fields on this tab are data for JDF files which this machine shall be able to receive and send.

The Auto Color fields are useful without any JDF to preset the ink selection for the press that is selected on a job item in a calculation. It is recommended to set the four process inks here if these are the major colors, so they don't need to be entered manually after each press selection on a job item.

 Example setup:

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 29.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 29.jpg)

Result after a press (within a List of Units) was selected:

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 30.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 30.jpg)

### Info
In this tab, information fields display who has created, and perhaps edited, the configuration and when it was done. Then, the fields display which department the configuration belongs to.

You may also give the Configuration an External Description. This is used if the configuration is applied to customer-related prints.

By selecting the Hide in Shop Floor field, you may choose that the selected configuration is not to be presented in connection with Shop Floor time recording.

## Cost Center Rates
Via this window, the hourly rates for a Configuration or for an individual operation on the Configuration are created and maintained. These hourly rates actually enable the calculation of Cost prices, Total costs, and Sales prices of all the company's time operations.

You can access "different" Rates from the Configuration Card:

![Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 31.jpg](./assets/Cost Center Setup - Configuration - Rates - Groups 31.jpg)

 Calculation of the "Sales" Price /h:
Price = Direct Cost (=Variable + Labor Cost) + Overhead (=> Direct Cost + Overhead = Total Cost) + Profit


| **Field**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rate type**           | By a look-up in the field, choose between Fixed rate and Surcharge rate. If you select Fixed rate, the operations are calculated precisely on the basis of the hourly rate which matches the set-up parameters. this rate type is used most extensively. If you select Surcharge rate, must be selected on both the basic as well as the additional configurations, the hour price is summed up from the basic rate with a surcharge for each surcharge rate which appear from the selected additional configurations. If, for example, you have a rotary machine which prints and cuts the web in one cycle of opperations, it is possible that you may want a higher hourly rate when a cutting unit is selected.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Date**                | In this field, you enter a date which the selected rate is to apply from. This helps maintain your price history by creating new hourly rate lines as prices adjust.    |
| **Product Group**       | If individual hourly rates are to be differentiated for an individual Product Group, select the desired group by a look-up in the field.                               |
| **Price group**         | If individual hourly rates are to be differentiated for an individual Price Group, select the desired group by a look-up in the field.                                 |
| **Customer group**      | If individual hourly rates are to be differentiated for an individual Customer Group, select the desired group by a look-up in the field.                              |
| **Alternative Rates Code** | Alternative Rates are used in Additional Rates and Cost Center Rates to define individual rates.                                                                  |
| **Price calculated from** | Select what the indicated price is to be calculated from. Common options include Hours, Pcs, 1000 pcs., lbs/Kg, Square feet/meters, Feet/Meters.                       |
| **Variable costs**      | Indicate the amount which incurs in fixed variable costs per hour, such as costs for Electricity, Rags, Lubrication, etc.                                              |
| **Labor costs**         | Indicate labor costs per hour for the selected configuration. For machines operated by multiple people, enter the total time rate for the group.                        |
| **Direct costs**        | Displays the Configuration Cost price - the sum of Variable and Labor costs.                                                                                        |
| **Overhead**            | Indicate the Configuration's share of company overhead, such as Rent, Administration, etc.                                                                          |
| **Total cost**          | Displays the Configuration Total cost - the sum of Direct costs and Overhead.                                                                                        |
| **Net profit**          | Enter a precise amount for how much net profit should be calculated per hour. This impacts how the Sales price is calculated based on Total cost + Net profit.         |
| **Net profit %**        | Enter a precise percentage for how much net profit should be calculated per hour. Sales price is based on Total cost + Net profit %.                                  |
| **Price**               | In this field, the Sales price which is to apply to the configuration is displayed or enetered.                                                                                                                                                                      |


### "Rates" action
The rates are displayed or can be entered for the Configuration the rates are opened from.


### "All Rates" action
The rates are displayed or can be entered for all Configurations of "this" cost center.


### "Rates" action on Operations Subpage
The rates are displayed or can be entered for the operation that was selected when hitting the rates action button.

In some special cases, it might be useful to set up a rate for an operation that is different from the rate of the configuration. This could be the case if an operation is made to calculate cost for assistance operations.

**Please note:** When entering this rate area but no rate is required, make sure there is no entry with rates = 0 that will override the rate from the configuration with 0 cost/price. To be sure, press the "Delete" Action button before closing the page.


## Cost Center Groups
Cost Center Groups can be assigned to each Cost Center and can be used in custom reports.

If totals for a group of Cost Centers (the total cost for all presses of one or more facilities/plants) are required, a report can be built based on the Cost Center Group setup.

The usage of Cost Center Groups is not mandatory.
