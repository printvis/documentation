# PV Unit of Measure - PV Assisted Setup


## Introduction

The PrintVis Unit of Measure is used to structure job costing data. For labor hours, it serves as a "Job Costing Operation" and is mapped with the (pre-) calculation structure.

PrintVis Unit of Measure is a concept created for PrintVis. It is a tool for configuring and controlling job costing functions, including:

- Calculation of cost price, self-cost, and sales price during the registration of incurred costs.
- Presentation of input for job costing in printouts or display pictures.
- Configuration of data input/bookkeeping behavior.
- Appearance of the unit of measure on the electronic Job ticket.
