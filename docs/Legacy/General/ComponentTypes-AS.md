# Component Types - PV Assisted Setup


## Introduction

The PrintVis Component Types can be used to set defaults for every job item to automate and simplify user input. These component types serve as a "small template" to preset default sheet, imposition, or finishing settings. They can be assigned to each Product Group (PrintVis Product Group Lookup Filters) to ensure that only the relevant ones for the actual product group are available for selection. This setup should be completed after finishing the PrintVis Assisted Setup (RapidStart).
