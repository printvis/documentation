## Introduction  

PrintVis Onboarding is designed to assist users in getting started with the software, understanding its features, and becoming proficient in its use. This initiative builds on past efforts to simplify the onboarding process, aligning with Microsoft's enhancements to the onboarding experience in Business Central.  

With a few simple steps, users can start a trial period to explore the system's functionalities hands-on.  

Our primary goal is to streamline the initial setup and exploration process, making it intuitive and efficient for users.  

Included in this guide are screenshots and detailed instructions to help users complete each setup step effectively.
