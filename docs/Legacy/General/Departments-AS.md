# Departments - PV Assisted Setup


## Introduction

Departments define where Cost Centers (employees and machinery) belong and are used throughout the system for statistical purposes. They are the primary grouping for various screens, such as calculation windows, the shop floor, and in certain reports, such as the job ticket.

The setup of production departments is crucial for:

- **Cost Centers**: Cost centers are connected to a department, affecting the entire estimating and job costing processes.
- **Job Tickets**: Production departments are divided on the job ticket, which must be considered when setting up departments.
- **Sorting**: Lists in the system are sorted according to the placement of departments in this table.
