# Format Codes - PV Assisted Setup


## Introduction

Standard Units is an essential setup for measuring units related to format sizes, paper weights, and thicknesses. It defines the units of measure that are predefined for the sizes of machines, papers, products, their margins, and other parameters.

Format codes have multiple purposes, including:
- Calculating the imposition for production.
- Acting as parameters in Speed Tables, Price Lists, Scrap Tables, etc.
- Displaying the format on the right-hand side so you can verify the format height and width.

## Setup

3. **US Standard Units based on the Imperial System**

Make sure to select the correct units that best suit your company. Once you have made your selection, click the **"OK"** button at the bottom of the page.

   Adjustments can be made if the default Type does not use the corresponding units. For example, in the US, not every company uses M-Weight for Paper Weight. Enter the correct formula and make further adjustments to get the desired unit for Paper Weight.
