# Finding Hidden Field Values - Page Inspection

## Page Inspection in PrintVis

PrintVis offers custom views of job data, tailored to a user's needs and role within the company. For example, a production manager doesn’t need to see all the company finances, and a shop floor worker doesn’t need to examine every facet of the estimate for a job he’s running. However, there are occasions when it’s necessary to view minor details within a case, such as contact information for a specific representative who sent in the quote or other quantities originally requested.
