# Status Codes - PV Assisted Setup


## Introduction
Status Codes are an integrated tool in PrintVis which directs the workflow of a case through the company on a general level; controlling whether, for example, you may register job costing, plan, invoice, etc. On selected points, it also controls whether a case has been created correctly before it changes status, etc. It is important that you consider how you want to control individual cases when you set up the company's status codes. You must also consider the demands made on the case and what a case is allowed in each individual status.



When the company's status codes have been created, you must also set up a natural status flow and set up who is to be responsible for a case when it reaches a given status. You do this in the Responsibility areas window.
