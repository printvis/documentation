# Product Group - PV Assisted Setup


## Introduction

Product Groups are a sub-topic of Order Types used to manage basic information on orders and categorize products for statistical analysis, such as production and sales data. Each Product Group is attached directly to a Case, allowing the case to be included in the selected Product Group for statistical purposes and potentially controlling imposition information and basic templates for specific job lines.
