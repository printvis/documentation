# Order Type - PV Assisted Setup


## Introduction
Order Types are used in the system to generate statistics to measure production. Typically, the Order Type is combined with a product group. Hereby, you may get an overview of how much each product group sells per Order Type. Order Types are attached directly to a Case.



Furthermore, the setup of Order Types gives you the option - by marking the product group field filter - that only the product groups which are setup with affinity to the order type may be selected. Another option is to let the selection Order Type control which Status Code a case shall be started in - the required code is selected via the Status Code field. Thus, all cases attached to the selected order type will automatically be attached to the selected eco-label. You may also select between the systemâ€™s standard eco-labels via the field, "Eco-labels."



Order Types are also used in the "Responsibility Areas" to control the workflow of an order.
