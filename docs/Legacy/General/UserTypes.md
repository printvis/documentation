# PrintVis User Types


## Summary

This document explains the different user types and their respective licenses for PrintVis Cloud. It supports the sales process by helping determine which user licenses a potential customer needs.

## License Model

With Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, all licensing is based on a **"named user"** model. This simplifies understanding and budgeting for the correct licensing.

Business Central Licenses

- Business Central licenses are purchased separately from PrintVis licensing.
- Note the limitations of Business Central licenses when combined with PrintVis licenses. For example, Business Central Team Member licenses can only modify 15 unique non-BC tables per login.
- When PrintVis indicates "Total Access to the System," this could be limited by the chosen Business Central license.
