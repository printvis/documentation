# Shipments - Touchpoints between Business Central and PrintVis


## PrintVis Shipments

Most of the PrintVis customers are companies that are not producing products for inventory, but the products are make-to-order and are order specific/unique. For these customers, typically no items /inventory for the production result/output are created.

PrintVis Shipments are mostly designed to use PrintVis functionality, which means that by default Business Central Sales Orders are not being used. There are some Business Central integrations and a couple API integrations existing, but PrintVis Shipments are able to create Sales Orders or Posted Sales Shipments as well if needed. Logistics add-ons or Business Central might need those entries.

### nShift

PrintVis has developed an integration with nShift for direct handling of parcel shipments. We primarily see nShift used in Europe. nShift information can be found here: https://nshift.com.


## PrintVis Shipments "Put On Stock" Function

PrintVis is also able to create inventory during the shipment process. This is because it is able to create Sales Orders and Posted Sales Shipments in the background, which requires inventory for shipment.
