# Color Table - PV Assisted Setup

## Introduction

The Color Table section allows users to assign custom codes and texts to the colors Cyan, Black, Magenta, Yellow, and Varnish. These codes are used to identify items on the Item card and other sections of the system, such as the color table on the Job Card. The text field is for adding descriptions to further identify the items.
