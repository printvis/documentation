# PrintVis Role Centers - Profiles

## Summary

In Business Central, all users are assigned profiles that reflect their business roles, departments, or other categorizations. Profiles allow administrators to manage what different user types can see and do in the user interface, enabling efficient task performance.

A **Role Center** gives users quick access to information pertinent to their daily work, displaying relevant data and facilitating navigation to necessary pages for tasks.

PrintVis extends this functionality by providing specific Role Centers for various user roles in a printing company.

In this document, the term "Profile" encompasses both roles and profiles, referring to the same concept.

## Usage

PrintVis profiles aim to provide access to specific print production-related areas of PrintVis and Business Central. If a company wishes to create custom profiles, it is recommended to copy an existing profile with the required access and modify it, keeping the original PrintVis profiles intact.

Profiles are assigned to users under "User Settings" (field "Role"). If no profile is assigned, the default profile is used. Profiles can be copied and saved under a custom name on the Profiles page.
