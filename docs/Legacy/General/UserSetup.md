# Setting Up a PrintVis User

## Summary

Every user in PrintVis must be a named user. The user setup is to be made in two steps:

1. **PrintVis Licensed User**  
   The user must be licensed if the status is "Enabled." The user and license type will be controlled.
   
2. **PrintVis User**  
   All detailed settings for the user are made here.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **PrintVis User ID** | This is the identifier for the licensed user. Typically, it is equal to the Business Central User Name. |
| **Status** | Only select "Enabled" if the user is licensed. |
| **Business Central User Name** | This links to the Business Central User, which needs to be set up first. |
| **Name** | Name of the user. This field controls the name for the PrintVis User Setup. Changes must be made here. |
| **E-mail** | E-mail address of the user. This field controls the e-mail for the PrintVis User Setup. Changes must be made here. |

### Fact Box Information

| **Field**                     | **Description** |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Users Used**                | Information about the users that are enabled in this database. |
| **Full Users**                | Shows the number of full users that are enabled. |
| **Registration Users**        | Shows the number of registration users that are enabled. |
| **Advanced License Required** | Indicates if all full users need to be advanced users. Required, for example, if the PrintVis Planning Board and CIM functionality is in use. |
| **Users Licensed**            | Information about the users registered in the PrintVis License system. |
| **Full Users**                | Shows the number of full users that are registered. |
| **Registration Users**        | Shows the number of registration users that are registered. |
| **Advanced**                  | Shows if advanced users are registered. |

A mismatch between the registered license and used license is a violation of the license terms!

Note: PV Licensed User page/table is instance specific now and the PV Users page is company specific. So if you are on the Users page and go to pick a User ID, you see the full list of licensed users for the instance.

## Setting up a PrintVis User

Before creating or copying a PrintVis User, it is mandatory to create a PrintVis Licensed User first.  

The PrintVis User Setup defines the user's rights in the system and customizes their menu. Users must be set up with relevant rights and company-specific information (e.g., function, field of activity).  

A Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central user must first be created, then assigned an ID, password, and rights via roles and permissions that include PrintVis objects.

### Page Actions

#### Status Codes
When clicking the action "Status Codes," the following list opens. For every new line, it is possible to select a status code for this user.

![Setting Up a PrintVis User 10.jpg](./assets/Setting Up a PrintVis User 10.jpg)

PrintVis provides the possibility to limit status codes per user. On each PrintVis User, a set of status codes can be selected from the existing status codes. With such setup, it is only possible for the given user to work on a limited workflow, and the user cannot change to other status codes than the ones selected in the PrintVis user setup.

This could be used, for example, if a user should not be able to create orders, quotes, etc.

The screenshot shows an example where the user can only work on requests and templates. This could be a user who is calculating prices and maintaining templates but cannot create quotes and process a case further through the workflow.
