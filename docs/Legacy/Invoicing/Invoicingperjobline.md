# Invoicing Per Job Line

## Introduction

On a PrintVis Case Card, many companies prefer to have 1 active job line.

It is in fact also possible to have more than one active job on a case card.

When this is the case, it becomes imporant to be able to separate the jobs and amounts so the customer can see what they are invoiced for.


## Setup


This is a methodology which requires an invoice template.


The invoice template would look like this:


![Invoicing per job line 1.jpg](./assets/Invoicing per job line 1.jpg)


Note that the Invoice method is Shipment.

## Example


The job lines on a case card look like this:


![Invoicing per job line 2.jpg](./assets/Invoicing per job line 2.jpg)


3 different jobs.

Each active job has its own shipment - here is a list where the Job number has been removed from the filter, so it shows all shipments:

![Invoicing per job line 3.jpg](./assets/Invoicing per job line 3.jpg)


The shipments are all Shipped.


At this point, you can see  a build-up of the invoice:

![Invoicing per job line 4.jpg](./assets/Invoicing per job line 4.jpg)
