# Combined Invoicing

## Summary

Customers with frequent scheduled or smaller jobs may require you to send them 1 invoice for the jobs of a period rather than one for every job.

Here is how you can combine invoices from more orders.


### Create Invoice

On each job, create a new invoice and build up the lines.

Adjust the lines and the amount so you have the pricing and wording you want.

Make sure all jobs are in status INVOICE and all jobs have their own invoice prepared
