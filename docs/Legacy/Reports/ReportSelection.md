**Report Selection**

Summary

When working with various documents for sales and purchases (orders,
quotes, invoices, credit memos, and so on), you can print different
reports. For example, to print a sales invoice, click the Posting button
on an invoice in a sales application area and select 'Post and Print'.

Which reports are printed when you click the Print button on various
types of purchase and sales headers is predefined. For example, when
clicking the Print button on an order, the Order Confirmation report is
automatically printed.

The Report Selections table contains the specification of which report
will be printed in different situations. The Report Selection table also
contains the report ID and report name for the report that will be
printed when you work with a given document type. You can, of course,
choose to have the program print a different report than the preselected
one. You can also add reports to the Report Selection table to have the
program print more than one report per document type.
