However, when you are making many changes and testing straight on in the
same session, you may want to consider the following refreshing options:
Report 6010303 reads the setup with each generation and print.

-   Close and reopen Case Card

-   Recalculate job

-   Deactivate and reactivate active version (Planning units)

Report Selection

There are different PrintVis Job Tickets. Report No. 6010303, 6010370,
and 6010900 (newer version). The newer version has a different
formatting and also allows users to what fields/information is being
used in the RDLC file easier.

In order to see the different reports, see the different layouts, and
make changes to the layout in the Report Layout Selection page:
