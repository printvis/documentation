# Creating a Case with Contact Only (no existing customer account)

## Introduction

This article provides a guideline on how to create a case for a contact where there is no customer account yet. When dealing with contacts of type "Person," note that this type cannot be changed into a customer account. A customer-related contact must be of type "Company."

## Workflow

### Request / Quote

If a request comes in from a new contact, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a Contact of Type "Company"**: 
   - Create a new contact with the type set to "Company."
   - This will allow you to capture general details about the company the person is requesting a quote for.

2. **Create a Contact of Type "Person"**:
   - Create a new contact with the type set to "Person" for the individual you are communicating with.
   - Assign this person to the previously created company contact.

3. **Select the Person on the Case**:
   - When creating the case, select the "Person" contact you have just created.

- **Sell-To Contact**: Shows the person's data as usual.
- **Sell-To Company Contact**: Displays the No. of the person's company. (This field will be visible only when selecting "Show More" on the General tab.)

### Order

If the case needs to be changed to a status of type "Order," a customer account must be created. The following options will be available:

1. **Clicking "Yes"**:
   - A customer will be created after selecting a customer template.
   - This is the recommended flow and requires proper setup of customer templates.

2. **Clicking "No"**:
   - A customer will be created without using a customer template, using only the contact data.
   - Before proceeding with posting shipments or invoices, ensure the customer is updated with all missing data, such as posting information.
