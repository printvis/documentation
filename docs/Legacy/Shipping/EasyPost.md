### Label Fields 

#### Reference Fields for Labels

Up to three reference fields can be added to the label, pulled from the EasyPost setup.
- **Predefined Packages**: Pulled from the EasyPost setup to determine the correct rate based on package type.


There are 3 fields on the shipment card called:

- **Label Reference 1** / **Reference Code 1**
- **Label Reference 2** / **Reference Code 2**
- **Label Reference 3** / **Reference Code 3**

These are optional fields that can be filled out to be displayed on the label when it is printed.


The **reference code fields** are pulled from the **EasyPost Options setup**. This list is:


- Filtered if a **Shipping Agent** is selected on the shipment.
- Shows **all codes** if no shipping agent is selected.

![EasyPost Shipping Integration 20.jpg](./assets/EasyPost Shipping Integration 20.jpg)

- The **ship-to name** of the company to be displayed on the label.
- The **ship-to contact** field to display which person at the ship-to customer should receive the package(s).

#### Predefined Packages

The **Predefined Packages** field values in the **Details** section of the Shipment Card are pulled from the **EasyPost Options setup**. This list is:

![EasyPost Shipping Integration 22.jpg](./assets/EasyPost Shipping Integration 22.jpg)

- Filtered if a **Shipping Agent** is selected on the shipment.

![EasyPost Shipping Integration 23.jpg](./assets/EasyPost Shipping Integration 23.jpg)

- Shows **all packages** if no shipping agent is selected.

The predefined package is sent to **EasyPost** when verifying the shipment to pull the appropriate rate for that package type.


### Customs

At the bottom of the Shipment card, there is an **EasyPost FastTab** that holds the information for **customs** when sending a shipment to an **international address**.

![EasyPost Shipping Integration 24.jpg](./assets/EasyPost Shipping Integration 24.jpg)

The information placed in the fields will be passed to **EasyPost**. The **commercial invoice** gets returned with the shipping label in the PDF sent back by EasyPost when customs information is included.
