# Register Receipts in PrintVis


This article explains how to register receipts in PrintVis. The standard Business Central functionality is not the scope of this document.

## Register Receipts

PrintVis has three possible methods to register receipts:
1. From the Purchase Order
2. Use Purchase Receipt List
3. Use Receipt Overview

### From a Purchase Order

2. Open the purchase order

The advantage of the PrintVis Purchase Receipt page is that all fields irrelevant to the Shipping department are locked, so the document can only be posted as a "Receipt" and not accidentally as an invoice, which is possible on the standard purchase order.
