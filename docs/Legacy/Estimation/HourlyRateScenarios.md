# The Hourly Rate Calculator Scenarios by PrintVis


## Introduction

The Hourly Rate Calculator is designed to assist in calculating the hourly rate used for cost centers, providing a valuable tool for our Partners and Customers. This tool takes into account all factors affecting the appropriate rates for a printer's specific operations—fixed and variable costs, materials, labor, and overhead. By aggregating these amounts, the calculator determines the optimal rate per cost center to help maintain a company's profitability and viability.

| Action       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **New**      | This is how you can create a new scenario from scratch. This opens the primary page for establishing a scenario allowing you to complete all fields manually. |
| **Open Wizard** | The wizard allows you to step through the scenario setup process in an organized way. You can use the wizard for newly created scenarios or to modify scenarios that have already been completed. <br><br>In order to use the wizard you must first use **New** to create the scenario that will be used by the wizard. The only fields required in this new scenario are the **Code** and **Description** fields. Highlight the newly created scenario and select **Open Wizard**. |
