- A complete calculation includes all product parts and calculation units for every job line. 
- Not all fields must be filled. The “External Description” field is used as the Template description.

**Warning!**

- Avoid manual or fixed entries in the calculation. Templates should be adaptable to changing conditions, such as higher quantities.
