# Assign inks to 2 or more print processes / print passes


## Summary

When a sheet goes through multiple presses, it's important to assign the ink used for each press accurately. This process is detailed as follows:

## How to ...?

1. **Select Initial Press**:
   - In the job item setup, choose the first press that the sheet will go through.

2. **Add Second Press**:
   - On the estimation page, add another press as a calculation unit. Ensure you do not select a list of units that includes paper; only select the press.
   - If plates are required for the second press, create a separate list of units for the press and plates only. Avoid adding a paper unit for this press, but if it appears, it wonâ€™t be double-counted due to the smart PV formulas. However, having two paper lines might be confusing if one shows a quoted price of 0.

3. **Adjust Sorting**:
   - Ensure the second press is sorted correctly, appearing after the first press for accurate scrap calculations.

4. **Assign Ink to Each Press**:
   - On the ink/color page, select the machine by its process number. Use the

6. **Verify Calculation Details**:
   - Ensure that the calculation details for each press only display the inks assigned to that specific press.
