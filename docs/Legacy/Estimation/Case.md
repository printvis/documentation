# Case Card and Case List 

## Case List

When using Case Management in PrintVis, the Case List will be the basic
window for the individual employee. All the daily jobs, depending on
their status, will appear in the relevant employees' Case lists.

The Case Management aspect of the system is designed to be the daily
home base of administration for all employees involved with orders. It
grants a full view of cases with detailed information on deadlines,
delivery dates, customer information, job history, etc. Consider each
Case as a repository for all the information of each individual order,
from quote to invoice. With Case Management, you control and follow the
flow of jobs throughout your company with a full overview of outstanding
quotes, confirmed orders, and jobs in progress.

In the Case List, it's possible to use the "list" view as below.

view with pictures from the Case Card.

| Recalculate Job  | This function recalculates the current job. Recommended when a case was copied. Takes less performance than recalculating all jobs.                                                                             |

**Job line fields**

| Field     | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Job       | Job is the internal reference to the PrintVis Job Table automatically assigned by the system when a new job is created. Generally, only one Job will be created for each Case, however for some combined products it can make sense to create multiple Jobs for one Case. You will naturally only be able to have one job even when a case consists of more sheets or job items (typically Content and Cover). Please bear in mind the status for all Jobs follows the status code for the entire Case. |
| Version   | Version is the internal reference to the possible versions of a Job. Often you will be asked to offer different alternatives of a Job to your customer, which is handled by making multiple Versions. Further new Versions will be created as a Case goes up in Status (from Request to Quote to Order). Please note: if you have created multiple Versions for a quotation, you will need to specify which of these alternatives is to be made the active Order Version. Place your cursor on the required version, make it active, and then activate Job Processing and select Order. |
| Active    | When a new job or a new version is created for a job, it will be active as the default setting. It is only possible to have one active version of a job within the same Status. Therefore, it is possible to have an active quote version and an active order version of the same job. An active job entails more options and possibilities. First, you may set up the company's status codes to make sure that only active jobs can be edited. Thereby, you make sure that you do not edit the wrong version by mistake. Second, a number of prints will only print the active job(s) within the selected type. For example, the model company's Job Ticket is printed only for the active order version of the job. A job line cannot be active if it is to be deleted. If you want to delete a case, it must not contain any active jobs. |
| Type      | This is a non-editable field, displaying the type for each Version. The status will change from Request to Quote as the Status code indicates so, for Order and Production Order new versions will be created for these. This will allow you to have and keep complete track of the Job/Version history for the Case. Setup on the Status codes lets you decide which versions are editable, allowing you to ensure that you can only edit information on active Jobs and Versions within the current Status. |
| Alternative | By a lookup in the field, you may choose that the version of a job is to be independent - Blank: you may choose to define the version is used when the job is an alternative estimate on the basis of changed quantity, page number, colors, or similar - Alternative: is used when the job is used for estimating a specific (or more specific) surcharge(s), such as UV varnishing, lamination, or similar - Additional option for the alternative. The information on Alternative and Additional may be used on printed Quotes, for example. The system will then print one line per estimated alternative and one line for each Addition so that Additional Alternative is priced with the price of the line minus the price of the job to which the version is an Addition. Common to both is that the description of the alternative or the addition is described in the External description field. |
| Item No.  | Item No. relates to the No. field in the Item table. Inserting a specific Item No. for the Job, will automatically update the entire Job/Version according to the Template attached to that particular Item. This enables you to have specific templates to individual Items, or a template for a group of Items, and to simply use such template by writing the Item No. on the Job. This field is also required if releasing finished goods to inventory. |
| Product Code | The PrintVis Products can be looked up on this field. The PrintVis Products can be used as template and data carrier for re-runs, in case the product doesn't need to be put on stock and tracked as inventory. In case the product must be put on stock and tracked as inventory, a Business Central Item can be linked with the product and will be added to the case/job as well, to able to release finished goods to the inventory after the production is finished. |
| Template ID | A range of templates can be created for each Product group, and a particular general template even attached to a Product group. When a New Job/Version is created, the template from the Product group is automatically inserted. If you wish to use another template, just lookup from the field, and select the required Template. |
| Ordered Quantity | The number of units the customer ordered, which could possibly be different than the quantity produced and/or shipped. |
| Pages     | The number of pages in the job. Generally, you state the number of "Pages with Print or Total Pages." Please see article: <https://support365.printvis.com/support/solutions/articles/17000124534-how-to-no-of-pages-pages-with-print> |
| Format Code | Indicate the format of the finished item as you would look at it. Formats can be entered either as a Format code (having defined standard formats such as A4, A5, Legal, Letter etc.) or simply entered displaying the format with a multiplicator-sign between the 2 formats (* or x). The unit used for the formats follows your setup for General Units such as mm, cm or inches. You may, however, freely combine such formats using cm, mm or in, behind the given format. Hence, if you are running your setup in cm (centimeters) but wish to enter a format as mm*inches, you can do so by writing 210mm x 11in. |
| Colors Front | The number of colors for the primary side of the job. |
| Colors Back | The number of colors for the secondary side of the job. If there is no print on the secondary side, the field is left empty. |
| Quoted Price | Price of the job displayed according to the selected price method - the price may be overwritten directly in the field as Fixed Quote Price for Job |
| Price Method | The Price Method field is automatically filled in according to the pricing of the job. For example, if you have fixed the quote price and return this field to Calculated, it will update the price for the job based on the calculated price. - Calculated - Fixed Quote Price for Job - Contribution Margin Locked - Contribution Margin % Locked - Manually per Calc Unit - Fixed Profit - Fixed Profit % - Addition % Self Cost - Special Addition % - Market Addition % - Fixed unit price - Item price |
| Product Group | The product group selected in the case card header is displayed but may be overwritten on the job line. However, the entire case in connection with statistics will act from the product group which has been selected in the case card header. |
| Discount Group | Discount Group relates to the Code field in the Discount Group table. Discount Groups can be used to grant a special Discount for a particular Job/Version, however, most commonly a discount group is inserted on the Case, to have all Jobs/Versions equally estimated with the same discount group. When choosing a Discount Group, the field Manual Discount Group is checked, to indicate this Discount Group was manually chosen, and prohibits the system from changing the field. |
| Price per 1000 pieces | Shows Quoted price per 1000 pieces. |
| Price per piece | Shows Quoted price per piece. |
| External Description | The external description is the descriptive text that will be displayed on many of the customer facing documents. This description often comes from the standard description field from the product group but can be manually added/edited. |
| Manual Description | If you have edited the description manually, this field is checked. If you remove the check, the automatically created description is displayed again. |
| Date Method | Time, Date, Week. The default setting in the field is Date for date method, but by a lookup in the field, you may change this to Week or Time. The date fields of the job will be filled in according to your choice. Date = write the date per regional formatting, Week = write the week number - if a week number which is lower than the present date is entered, the entered week number is regarded as being next year's week number. Time = Includes an actual delivery time. A standard Delivery time can be set up from PrintVis General Setup if your carrier comes at a fixed time daily. Format is according to your regional settings. |
| Requested Shipment Date/Time | According to the chosen date format, you state when the job is to be shipped to the customer. The date is mainly used for production planning, but will also function as, for example, paper purchasing date if you do not use production planning. In the setup of Status codes, you may require that the date must be filled in, for example, when the case reaches the Order Confirmed or the Planning Status code. |
| Destination Delivery Date | According to the chosen date format, you state when the job must arrive at the destination. The date is used for shipment. This field has no impact on production planning. |
| Destination Delivery Time | According to the chosen date format, you state when the job must arrive at the destination. The date is used for shipment. This field has no impact on production planning. |
| Production Status Code | The production status code is a read-only field that displays the current production status of the job based on the planning units marked completed. Before a case reaches a 'Can Be Planned' status, this field will remain blank. Once in a planned status, the field will display the status code associated with the next planning unit that hasn't yet been marked completed. Once all planning units for the job have been marked completed, the field will display the status code that has Production Ended = Yes. |
| Quantity Variation Code | Quantity Variation Code relates to the Code field in the Quantity Variation table. This allows the system to draw information (if chosen) about how much the final production is allowed to deviate (under and over) from the ordered quantity. |
| Job Name  | Is used to identify the Case and Job, and should contain a Headline which will enable you to re-find the job for later copying etc. |
| Production Status Code | The production status shows the status of the individual job once a job has reached the planning stage. When all of the planning lines have been marked completed, the status will be listed as the Production Ended status. This new field function as follows: - The field should be blank any time the case 'Can Be Planned' boolean is No. - When planning lines exist, find the earliest planning line for that job that is not marked complete and display the status code setting for that planning unit. - If all planning lines for that job are marked completed, display the status code that has the Production Ended = Yes value. |


The individual employee may work with all his/her cases in the Case
list exactly as if the cases were piled on the desk. A Case does not
disappear from the list before you have solved it and sent it on in the
Case flow. This is a critical component of a print company's success --
to ensure the print job production flow is organized and job information
is immediately accessible to each responsible party.
