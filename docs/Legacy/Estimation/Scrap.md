## Summary

- **Scrap Calculation**:
  - Scrap is calculated for each process that has a scrap setup (search for "Scrap Table Setup").
  - The Calculation Unit that calculates scrap must be marked as "Process Start."
  
![Scrap page 1.jpg](./assets/Scrap page 1.jpg)

  - Scrap is accumulated from the last process to the first process. The first process (typically the press) produces its own scrap and all scrap for the following processes. Each subsequent process produces its own scrap only, excluding the scrap from prior processes.
  - For jobs with multiple items processed together (e.g., saddle-stitching), scrap must be produced by all individual job item processes.
  - The format size of the scrap is considered.

| Printing Format Code   | If a specific Format Code is selected for the size of the Printing Format (paper/material size), the selected code will be displayed. When looking up from the field, only Format codes with type Printed Format will be displayed. In general, Printing Format will depend on the format/size of the Raw Material selected for the Job and the max. size given for the Printing Press. If such info is sufficient, no specific Printing Format Code is needed. |
| Width                  | Width – for the Print Sheet Format – is always displayed as Left/right format.
