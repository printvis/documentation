# Creating an Estimate


## Summary
Estimating in PrintVis involves calculating a quoted price for a requested product, such as a brochure. This estimate forms the basis for actions like:
- Printing a quote
- Creating an order
- Planning production

The estimate uses **calculation units**—definitions of production processes linked to cost center operations and items. All production processes influencing the quoted price must be included in the **calculation unit setup**.

 Case Card and Case List
To calculate the quoted price, key information such as **job quantity, sheets, and pages** must be entered. The user selects the necessary processes (calculation units) for producing the product.

## Case (Estimation) Workflow
The entire workflow is accessible from the **Case Card**. For experienced users, it’s easy to access the necessary areas. However, for new users, it's recommended to follow this structured flow:

1. **Case Card**: Open the Job Card.
2. **Job Card**: Create sheets and enter job item details.
3. **Estimating**: Select calculation units and input operational data.
4. **Specification**: Open this page for each sheet, check data, and amend details.
5. Close all pages and review pricing on the **Estimation tab** in the Job Card.
6. Create versions for additional price breaks, and edit user fields.
