# Finishing Types


## Summary

Finishing or postpress types streamline access to predefined "List of Calculation Units" related to finishing. The setup of Finishing Types is divided into two fields: one for job-related finishing and one for sheet-related finishing. This separation simplifies the selection process compared to earlier versions of PrintVis, which only had one finishing-type field.

 **Finishing Types**

Finishing Types can be found by searching: `PrintVis Finishing Types`
