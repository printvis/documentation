# Capacity Blockings and Blocking Codes

**Capacity Blockings** is a means of blocking time in the calendar while signaling to the planner what causes the blocking. This requires setup of actual blocking codes on the **Capacity Blocking Codes** page before they can be used to block anything.

## Capacity Blocking Codes

The **Blocking Codes** page is a simple setup page where the user is required to input a **Code** and a **Description**.

> Use **Sorting Order** if you have a lot of codes.  
> General good practice is to have a few easily understandable codes to begin with.

Once configured, the codes are ready to be used.

## Capacity Units - Capacity Blockings

From the **Capacity Unit** setup page, *Blockings* is one of the menu points.

 How to Create a Blocking

1. Go to a new line  
2. Pick the date you want to block

> The system will throw an error if the user attempts to set a blocking in this case.
