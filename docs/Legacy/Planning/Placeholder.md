# Placeholder

## Placeholder

Companies can reserve press time for specific customers using "Placeholders." When auto-scheduling, the system respects these placeholders for the designated customer. No other planning units will be scheduled during the reserved time if they belong to a different customer. However, if a planning unit is assigned to the designated customer and can be scheduled during the reserved time, the system will accommodate it.

### Setup

The Placeholder setup page can be accessed from the Production Plan page, Planning Board, or through a system search.

On the Planning Board Setup page, two fields represent the placeholder visually:

- **Placeholder Color:** The color of the placeholder bar.
- **Placeholder Text Color:** The color of the text in the placeholder.

 Note

If you are on the Planning Board while setting up a placeholder, refresh the Planning Board after completing the setup or exit and re-enter to display the placeholder bar.
