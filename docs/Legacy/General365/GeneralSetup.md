| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Application Type | PrintVis applies to Printing companies but also to other types of companies which may not use very specific printing pages and fields. For a unique, order-by-order production which is not based on production BOMs etc., PrintVis is the replacement for standard "Manufacturing" in 365 Business Central. PrintVis does not use BOMs or traditional routing. It is more the definition of job parts (called job "items," such as the cover and text of a book - its components) and the cost centers used for the production of those. If a company has different subsidiaries which are not all printing companies - and wants to use 365 Business Central without PrintVis, it is possible to disable the PrintVis functionality for those database companies. |
| General Manufacturing | Can be chosen if the print specific pages and fields will not be used. Estimation, document management, etc. will still work. |
| Print Manufacturing | Is used most of the time, any use of print specific description will benefit from the print specific pages. |
| Use Advanced | |
| Case Card | If enabled, the case card is a combination of the case card and job card, and the job is only opened to review the prices. It reduces the number of clicks for the user. The flow through all case details is: Case Card, Estimation, Specification. If disabled, the flow through all case details is: Case Card, Job Card, Estimation, Specification. |
| Quote No. Series | Quote No. Series relates to the "Code" field in table "No. Series". The Quote No. Series can be selected from the No. Series table. |
| Order No. Series | Order No. Series relates to the "Code" field in table "No. Series". The Order No. Series can be selected from the No. Series table. |
| Quote/Order no from Salesorder | This field relates to the Sales Order integration. If ticked, the Case Card quote or order number will be the sales order number, followed by a number. A Sales Order can be used to create several Case Cards and the xxx-1, xxx-2, etc. will make sure they are individually numbered for reference. |
| Shipment No. Series | Shipment No. Series relates to the "Code" field in table "No. Series". The Shipment No. Series can be selected from the No. Series table. This setup is mandatory, in case: Combined Shipments are in use The Case Shipment Method is set to "Create Posted Shipments" |
| Manual Contact Person | It is possible to enable or disable the ability for users of Case Cards to change the contact person which comes from the customer card. A tick in this field will enable this for the users. |
| Default Order Document | In Document Management, there may be several order confirmation documents. For automation of internal processes, it is an option to state a default document here. If the status changes to a status which generates an Order Number, this document may be automatically generated for the user. |
| Default Order Document Name | This field shows the Descriptive name of the default order document picked. |
| Search Name | The Case Card has a Search Name field which is updated from the user input. Here we can determine what is the most desired input: - Job Description - Customer Name |
| Exclude PrintVis Cases from Credit Limit check | By default, the quoted price on orders will be included in the total amount of the BC Credit Limit functionality. If this is not desired, you can switch this option on. Please note: The amount will include VAT in countries with VAT In countries with sales tax, the net amount will be included in the total amount |
| Do Not Show Customer Comments On Case Card | If a customer has comments attached to the customer card, these comments will be displayed by default after the customer is selected on a case card. If this is not desired, you can switch this option on. |
| Update Coupling Data Immediately | Immediately update coupled CRM data on changes. |
| Recreate Deleted CRM Data | If CRM data is deleted in the CRM system, checking this option will recreate this deleted information during the next update. |
| PrintVis Order CF Account No. | This field determines which Cash Flow Account the value of the PrintVis orders should be shown on. The use of this field requires active setup of Cash Flow. There is a white paper available on the setting and use of Cash Flow monitoring in PrintVis. |
