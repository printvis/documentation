| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Application Type | PrintVis applies to Printing companies but also to other types of companies which may not use very specific printing pages and fields. For a unique, order-by-order production which is not based on production BOMs etc., PrintVis is the replacement for standard "Manufacturing" in 365 Business Central. PrintVis does not use BOMs or traditional routing. It is more the definition of job parts (called job "items," such as the cover and text of a book - its components) and the cost centers used for the production of those. If a company has different subsidiaries which are not all printing companies - and wants to use 365 Business Central without PrintVis, it is possible to disable the PrintVis functionality for those database companies. |
| General Manufacturing | Can be chosen if the print specific pages and fields will not be used. Estimation, document management, etc. will still work. |
| Print Manufacturing | Is used most of the time, any use of print specific description will benefit from the print specific pages. |
| Use Advanced | |
| Case Card | If enabled, the case card is a combination of the case card and job card, and the job is only opened to review the prices. It reduces the number of clicks for the user.

| Default Time for Shipment Date  | The **Requested Shipment Date** includes both a date and time. If nothing is entered, the time defaults to **00:00**.

| Location Production Released | When production is completed on an order and goods are ready to ship, there may be surplus material (e.g., paper) not consumed on the order. This field determines the location for items on the shop floor upon release of material from reservation on the just-ended order. Options exist to set up specific locations on the shop floor per machine.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Auto Job Costing Journal     | Relates to the "Code" field in the "Job Costing Journal" table. The journal selected here will be used for automatic posting of time and materials to orders when production has ended. Whether items are posted automatically depends on the Unit of Measure set on material and time calculation lines in the estimate.                                                                                                                                        |
| Job Cost. Hour Unit Cost     | Allows for refined job costing based on efficiency, potentially affecting cost calculation and suggested sales price:<br> - Default: Uses standard time rates as they appear on the cost center.<br> - Weighted: Weighs recorded time against user efficiency (e.g., trainee efficiency at 50% turns 4 recorded hours into 2 hours for costing).<br> - Actual: Uses recorded hours factoring in any overtime setup from the unit of measure, giving a potentially higher cost.             |
| Dim1 Job Costing Mandatory   | Tick this field if a Dimension 1 value is mandatory for job costing. This requires system setup to avoid error messages on the shop floor if no value is provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Dim1 Job Costing Principle   | If job costing is mandatory, this field helps select the Dimension 1 value:<br> - Manual: The user inputs a value manually on each line or relies on system setup.<br> - Case: Automatically copies the Dimension 1 value from the case card.<br> - Department: Uses the department of the cost center for this line.<br> - User Department: Always uses the user setup department field.                                       |
| Def. UoM Paper               | Sets the default Unit of Measure (UoM) for paper items if a required unit is missing on the item card, ensuring all items have a UoM even if it’s not specifically set for each Paper-Item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Def. UoM Plates              | Sets the default UoM for plate items if required and no unit is provided on the item card. If a Plate Item No. lacks a UoM, the selected UoM here will apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Def. UoM Film                | Sets the default UoM for film items if required and no unit is provided on the item card. If a Film Item No. lacks a UoM, the selected UoM here will apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Def. UoM Die                 | Sets the default UoM for die items if required and no unit is provided on the item card. If a Die Item No. lacks a UoM, the selected UoM here will apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| UoM Slack Time               | Slack Time accounts for non-working machine time (e.g., breaks or idle periods). If using an electronic job ticket for time recording, the system can default a UoM to slack time for statistical purposes (e.g., machine efficiency rates). The "Slack time" action in the "Job Costing Worksheet" inserts a time entry from the last recorded stop time to the current time. If no UoM is stated, the function will not operate. |

| Create Shipment Item                   | When posting a PrintVis Shipment, the system can be set up to automatically generate a ‘standard 365 Business Central’ shipment as well, to accommodate for integration to 3rd party distribution systems, etc. You can then either use a single ‘dummy-item’, or have the system automatically generate a new item for each individual shipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Tax Area Code Mandatory on Shipment    | If the ‘Ship-to’ address is to define the Tax Area when posting an invoice for the production/shipment, the Tax Area Code must be set on each shipment.

| Case Shipment Method                   | This option field defines how the PrintVis shipment will be processed. - No Sales Order: All shipping will be managed through the PrintVis shipment card. - Create Sales Order Per Shipment: Shipment will create an open BC sales order. - Create Sales Order Per Shipment And Release: Shipment will create a released BC sales order. - Create Sales Order Per Shipment And Post: Shipment will create a BC posted sales shipment. In order to avoid a posted invoice with Amount=0, a future date must be set in the "Allow Document Deletion" before field on the "Sales & Receivables" setup page. - Create Posted Shipments: This will create a posted shipment directly without creating a sales order. No inventory is affected, and this option should be used in case a logistics extension needs posted shipments to pickup shipment data. (UPS, DHL FedEx tracking) Note: The PV function "Undo Shipment" works only with Method "No Sales Order." |
| Shipment Sales Order Removal           | When the sales order is created and posted as shipped, should it be removed? - On Ship (default) - On Archive - Never                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
